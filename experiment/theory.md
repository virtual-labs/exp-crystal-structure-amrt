## Theory 

Matter exist usually in solid or fluid (liquid, gas) state. According to modern concept matter classification is specified as condensed state and gaseous state. Solids and liquids come under condensed state. Any material whose position of constituent particles is fixed can be regarded as solids.

 

Solids are characterized by incompressibility, rigidity and mechanical strength. This indicates that the molecules, atoms or ions that make up as solid is closely packed. Thus in solids we will have a well ordered molecular, atomic or ionic arrangement.

In general solids can be classified into:

 

- Crystalline-particles are orderly arranged (long range order).
- Amorphous-particles are randomly oriented.
 

If the atoms or molecules are uniquely arranged in crystalline solid or liquid we call it as a crystal structure. A crystal posses long range order and symmetry. The main property of crystal structure is its periodicity. This periodicity is due to the arrangement of atoms/molecules in the lattice points. The crystal structure as a whole can be considered as the repetition of unit cell. For a given crystal structure the shape of unit cell is same but varies from crystal to crystal.

 

X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the constituent particles (molecules, atoms or ions) are arranged in a definite pattern in the crystal. To get the diffraction pattern the wavelength of light used must be comparable with the atomic spacing.

### Lattice
 

A crystal structure is formed only when the group of atoms is arranged identically at the lattice point. The group of atoms or molecules is called a basis. Lattice point is actually an imaginary concept.


 

 

In other way, we can say that,

Lattice + Basis=crystal structure

 

Line joining any two points is a translation in lattice. Two non-collinear translation leads to a plane lattice and three non coplanar translation leads to a space lattice.

### Unit cell
 

Unit cell can be considered as the building block of a crystal. It has the same symmetry as the entire crystal. When we arrange the unit cell in 3D, we get the bulk crystal. In other words it can be described as the smallest volume which when repeated in all direction gives the crystal. The three edges a, b, c along the axis and angle between them ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â±, ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â² and ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â³ is termed as lattice parameters. In 3D it is better to consider a parallelepiped as unit cell.

Unit cell can be of primitive as well as non primitive type. A primitive cell is a minimum volume unit cell and has only one lattice point in it and the latter contains more than one.

In the given figure below, simple cube is a primitive cell. No.of atoms per unit cell is one for it. The rest two is non primitive. No.of atoms per unit cell is 2 and 4 respectively.
